Repository for the storage and distribution of data and resources used during my Master's final project.  The main objective of the project is the collection and curation of historical data corresponding to teams and players of the league, as well as the application of different machine learning techniques for the prediction of results.

## Datasets
All data used during our study can be directly downloaded and subsequently used through the code provided in this repository. 

However, in order to ensure their maintenance, we plan to upload these files on a recurring basis.
